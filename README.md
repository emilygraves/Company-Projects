Work completed while working as a Data Scientist.

As a data scientist at Vast, I have worked on numerous projects in the Real Estate and Automotive spaces. The majority of my work was spent researching, building, and testing models in order to predict a vehicle's "days on lot" - or how long until the car would sell. These predictions would be passed along to dealers, enabling them to better price their vehicles to either sell faster, or optimize profits. 

The work in this repository is organized by project.
